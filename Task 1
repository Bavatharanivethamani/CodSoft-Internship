Task 1 : TO-DO-LIST 

Creating a To-Do List application in Python is a great project to help users manage and organize their tasks. Below, I will outline the steps for both a command-line and a GUI-based application using Python.

1. Command-Line To-Do List Application (CLI)
The command-line version of the To-Do List app allows users to interact with the app via text commands. You can use basic Python libraries to implement this.

Features:
    Add a task.
    Remove a task.
    Update a task.
    View all tasks.
    Mark a task as completed.
    Save tasks to a file so that they persist across sessions.
Steps to Create CLI To-Do List:
1.Define the Task Class: A task can have attributes such as title, description, and status (e.g., "completed" or "not completed").
2.Create Functions for Task Operations: These functions will allow the user to add, update, delete, and display tasks.
3.Main Loop to Handle User Input: The main loop allows the user to interact with the application via a menu.

Key Points:
Task Class: 
     The class encapsulates task attributes like title, description, and status.
Task Operations:
     Functions like add, update, delete, and mark as completed ensure the app remains interactive.
GUI:
     tkinter provides an intuitive interface for adding and managing tasks, along with buttons for easy interactions.
