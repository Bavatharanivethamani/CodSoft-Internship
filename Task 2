Task 2: Calculator

Design a Simple Calculator program with basic Arithmetic Operation using python.
Explanation:
Functions:
        Each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) is defined as a separate function (add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide()).
The divide() function also checks if division by zero is attempted, in which case it returns an error message.

User Input:
        The program first asks the user to choose an operation by entering 1, 2, 3, or 4.
Then, the program prompts the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). The float() function is used to ensure that the numbers can be decimals as well.

Calculation:
        Depending on the operation chosen by the user, the corresponding arithmetic function is called, and the result is displayed.
If an invalid operation is selected, or the user enters non-numeric input, an error message is displayed.
Error Handling:
        There's basic error handling for invalid numeric input using try-except blocks.
If the user selects division (4) and tries to divide by zero, it displays an error message.
Key Points Explained:
Functions for Operations:

Each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) is defined as a function that takes two parameters and returns the result.
The divide function also checks for division by zero, which is an important edge case to handle.
User Input Validation:

try-except is used to handle invalid inputs for numbers, ensuring that the program doesn't crash when the user enters non-numeric values.
Menu and Operations:

The user is presented with a menu of choices (1, 2, 3, 4 for the operations and 5 to exit).
Based on the userâ€™s input, the corresponding arithmetic operation is performed, and the result is displayed.
Error Handling:

If the user enters an invalid operation choice (e.g., anything other than 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5), the program displays an error message.
Division by zero is handled in the divide function to prevent runtime errors.
Looping for Continuous Calculation:

The program uses a while loop to allow the user to perform multiple calculations in one session.
The loop exits when the user selects the 5 option to "Exit."
