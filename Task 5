This class is used to store individual contact details (name, phone, email, address).
The __str__ method allows us to format how the contact is displayed when printed.

The ContactManager class is where all the main functionalities are implemented. It uses a dictionary (self.contacts) to store contacts, with the contact name as the key.

view_contacts: Displays all contacts stored in the system.
